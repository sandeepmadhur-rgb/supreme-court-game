                    context: "In 1950s America, racial segregation was legal and enforced across the South. 'Separate but equal' had been the law since 1896. Schools, restaurants, and public facilities were divided by race. The civil rights movement was just beginning to gain momentum.",
                    contextDeep: "The 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision had established that racial segregation was constitutional as long as facilities were 'equal.' In practice, Black schools received a fraction of the funding of white schools. In the South, this inequality was stark: Black students used hand-me-down textbooks, attended schools without proper heating, and had far fewer resources. The NAACP had been methodically challenging segregation through the courts, winning cases about graduate schools and law schools. By the early 1950s, they were ready to challenge the foundation: elementary school segregation itself.",
                    facts: "Linda Brown, a Black third-grader, had to walk miles to her segregated school while a white school was just blocks away. Her father, with the NAACP, challenged school segregation in Topeka, Kansas.",
                    factsDeep: "The case actually combined five different cases from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and Washington D.C. Thurgood Marshall, who would later become the first Black Supreme Court Justice, led the legal team. They presented groundbreaking social science evidence, including psychologist Kenneth Clark's 'doll tests,' which showed that segregation damaged Black children's self-esteem. White children chose white dolls as 'nice' and Black dolls as 'bad.' When Black children made the same choices, it revealed the psychological harm of being told they were inferior. This was revolutionary—using social science in constitutional law.",

                    impact: "This decision dismantled legal segregation and energized the civil rights movement. It led to lunch counter sit-ins, Freedom Rides, and eventually the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Society's views on racial equality fundamentally shifted.",

Chief Justice Earl Warren worked tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure unanimity, knowing that a divided court would give segregationists ammunition to resist. There were no dissents, but the path to unanimity was complex—Justice Jackson had initially drafted a concurrence expressing doubts about using social science evidence.",
                        laterCases: "Brown II (1955) ordered desegregation 'with all deliberate speed,' but massive resistance followed. Southern states closed public schools rather than integrate. It took the 1964 Civil Rights Act and aggressive federal enforcement to truly implement Brown. Later cases like Green v. County School Board (1968) and Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg (1971) addressed busing and affirmative integration measures. The court's approach evolved from merely ending legal segregation to requiring active desegregation.",
                        modernControversy: "School segregation has resurged through de facto segregation—housing patterns and school district boundaries creating separate, unequal schools without explicit racial laws. Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle (2007) struck down voluntary integration plans that used race as a factor, with Chief Justice Roberts writing 'the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.' Critics argue this ignores ongoing inequality and reverses Brown's spirit."

The 'exclusionary rule'—excluding such evidence—only applied in federal courts after Weeks v. United States (1914). States were free to admit evidence however they obtained it. This created a two-tiered system where constitutional rights depended on whether you were prosecuted in state or federal court. Most criminal cases happened in state courts, meaning the Fourth Amendment was largely toothless for most Americans.",

They waited for backup, then forced their way in, allegedly waving a fake 'warrant' when she demanded to see it. She grabbed the paper and stuffed it in her bosom; police wrestled it back. They searched her entire house, including her basement and bedroom, finding allegedly obscene books and photos in a trunk. She claimed the materials belonged to a former boarder.

                        dissent: "Justice Harlan's dissent argued that the exclusionary rule was not constitutionally required and that deterring police misconduct was insufficient justification for potentially freeing guilty criminals. He believed states should be free to find other remedies, like civil suits against officers. Justice Stewart thought the conviction should be overturned on First Amendment grounds (the obscenity law itself was unconstitutional) rather than imposing a sweeping exclusionary rule on all states.",
                        laterCases: "The exclusionary rule has been steadily eroded through exceptions. United States v. Leon (1984) created the 'good faith exception'—if police reasonably believed a warrant was valid, evidence is admissible even if the warrant was defective. Hudson v. Michigan (2006) held that violations of the 'knock-and-announce' rule don't trigger exclusion. Herring v. United States (2009) allowed evidence when police errors were negligent rather than deliberate. Critics argue these exceptions have gutted Mapp's protections.",
                        modernControversy: "The exclusionary rule remains contentious. Conservatives argue it's a 'judge-made rule' that lets criminals escape justice over technicalities. They point out that most countries don't exclude illegally obtained evidence. Progressives counter that without exclusion, there's no effective remedy for Fourth Amendment violations—police can violate rights with impunity since civil suits rarely succeed. The debate intensified with mass surveillance and digital searches, where the exclusionary rule may be the only check on government overreach."

                    contextDeep: "The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel, but courts long interpreted this as merely the right to hire a lawyer if you could afford one—not a right to have one provided. In Betts v. Brady (1942), the Supreme Court ruled that appointed counsel was only required in death penalty cases or 'special circumstances' like mental disability. This left most poor defendants to fend for themselves in a complex legal system designed by and for lawyers. The disparity was stark: wealthy defendants had skilled advocates; poor defendants stumbled through trials, often not knowing basic rights or procedures.",

At his trial, he asked the judge to appoint a lawyer because he couldn't afford one. The judge refused, citing Florida law that only provided counsel in capital cases. Gideon did his best—cross-examining witnesses, presenting evidence—but he lacked legal training. He was convicted and sentenced to five years.

                    shortDesc: "Corporate political spending and free speech",
                    context: "In 2010, campaign finance laws limited corporate spending in elections. The McCain-Feingold Act restricted when corporations could air political ads. Money in politics was controversial, but most agreed on some limits.",
                    contextDeep: "Campaign finance reform had a long history. Watergate scandals led to the Federal Election Campaign Act, which the Court partially upheld in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), ruling that spending money is speech but contribution limits are constitutional to prevent corruption. The McCain-Feingold Act (2002) banned 'electioneering communications'—corporate-funded ads mentioning candidates within 60 days of general elections or 30 days of primaries. The law aimed to prevent corporations from influencing elections with treasury funds. Previous Court precedent in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990) upheld such restrictions. But the Roberts Court was skeptical of campaign finance limits, viewing them as restricting political speech.",
                    facts: "Citizens United, a conservative group, wanted to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton near the 2008 primary. The FEC blocked it under laws banning corporate-funded 'electioneering communications' near elections.",
                    factsDeep: "Citizens United, a conservative nonprofit, produced 'Hillary: The Movie,' a 90-minute documentary highly critical of Hillary Clinton. They wanted to air it on video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 Democratic primaries and run TV ads promoting it. The FEC said this violated McCain-Feingold's ban on corporate electioneering communications. Citizens United initially challenged the law narrowly, arguing the documentary was exempt. But at oral argument, the government lawyer said the logic of the law would allow banning books if corporations published them near elections. This alarmed the Court. The justices ordered re-argument on whether to overturn Austin and parts of McConnell v. FEC entirely—a much broader question than originally briefed.",
                    question: "Can the government restrict corporate political spending?",

                    ],
                    decision: "The Court ruled 5-4 that corporate political spending is protected speech under the First Amendment. The decision equated money with speech and said 'independent expenditures' don't corrupt or create appearance of corruption.",
                    impact: "This unleashed unlimited corporate and union money into elections through Super PACs. Campaign spending exploded. Critics say it gave wealthy interests outsized influence; supporters say it protected political speech.",
                    societalShift: "From: Broad acceptance of campaign finance limits → To: Unlimited independent political spending as constitutional right",

                        dissent: "Justice Stevens's 90-page dissent, his last major opinion, argued the majority misunderstood the First Amendment. He distinguished corporations from natural persons—corporations are legal fictions created by state law, not rights-bearing citizens. Unlimited corporate spending creates corruption and the appearance of corruption, drowning out individual voices. He accused the majority of 'judicial activism,' overturning decades of precedent and laws, and deciding issues not properly before the Court. Stevens warned of a 'cataclysmic' effect on democracy, predicting unlimited corporate money would distort elections.",
                        laterCases: "SpeechNow.org v. FEC (2010) quickly followed, applying Citizens United to allow unlimited contributions to Super PACs (committees making independent expenditures). McCutcheon v. FEC (2014) struck down aggregate contribution limits—the total amount individuals could give across all federal candidates and parties. These decisions created the current system: limited direct contributions to candidates but unlimited independent spending through Super PACs. Critics note the 'independent' label is fiction—Super PACs coordinate closely with campaigns despite nominal legal barriers.",
                        modernControversy: "Citizens United transformed American elections. Super PAC spending skyrocketed from virtually nothing to billions per cycle. A tiny number of mega-donors now dominate election funding. Critics argue this creates an oligarchy where wealthy interests control politics, pointing to studies showing politicians are more responsive to donors than constituents. Defenders argue spending hasn't proven to buy elections (many big spenders lose) and that restrictions are paternalistic—voters can assess arguments regardless of funding sources. Reform proposals include constitutional amendments, public financing, or disclosure requirements, but the Court's equation of money with speech makes regulation difficult."

                    shortDesc: "Same-sex marriage equality nationwide",
                    context: "In 2015, same-sex marriage was legal in some states but banned in others. Public opinion had shifted dramatically—from 27% support in 1996 to 60% in 2015. The gay rights movement had achieved growing acceptance, but marriage remained a battleground.",
                    contextDeep: "The gay rights movement's journey was remarkable. In 1986, Bowers v. Hardwick upheld laws criminalizing same-sex intimacy. Just 17 years later, Lawrence v. Texas (2003) overruled Bowers, decriminalizing same-sex relationships nationwide. Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in 2004. Some states followed through legislation or court decisions; others passed constitutional amendments banning it. The Defense of Marriage Act (1996) defined marriage federally as between man and woman. United States v. Windsor (2013) struck down DOMA's federal definition, requiring federal recognition of state-legal same-sex marriages. By 2015, the question was whether states could still ban same-sex marriage or whether the Constitution required nationwide recognition.",
                    facts: "James Obergefell sued Ohio after it refused to recognize his marriage to John Arthur (who had since died). Multiple same-sex couples from several states challenged laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman.",
                    factsDeep: "The case consolidated challenges from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. James Obergefell and John Arthur, together 20+ years, married in Maryland because Ohio banned same-sex marriage. Arthur was dying of ALS. They wanted Obergefell recognized as surviving spouse on the death certificate. They chartered a medical plane to Maryland, married on the airport tarmac, and flew home. Arthur died three months later. Ohio refused to list Obergefell as spouse. Other plaintiffs included couples denied marriage licenses and couples whose out-of-state marriages weren't recognized for adoption, death benefits, and other purposes. All raised Fourteenth Amendment challenges: denying marriage violated due process (fundamental right to marry) and equal protection (discriminating based on sexual orientation).",

                    impact: "Same-sex marriage became legal nationwide overnight. This represented one of the fastest shifts in social attitudes and law in American history—from criminalization to constitutional protection in just decades.",

                    deepDive: {
                        dissent: "All four dissenting justices wrote separate opinions. Chief Justice Roberts argued marriage has been understood as between man and woman throughout history, and the Court was imposing its policy preferences rather than interpreting the Constitution. He warned that the decision short-circuited democratic debate and would fuel resentment. Justice Scalia called it a 'judicial putsch' and 'threat to American democracy.' Justice Thomas argued it violated states' sovereignty and individual liberty by forcing participation in same-sex marriages. Justice Alito emphasized that marriage has historically been about procreation and child-rearing, and many religions view same-sex marriage as inconsistent with their beliefs.",
                        laterCases: "Post-Obergefell litigation focuses on religious liberty conflicts. Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado (2018) ruled for a baker who refused to make a same-sex wedding cake, but on narrow grounds of religious hostility by the civil rights commission, not establishing a broad religious exemption. 303 Creative v. Elenis (2023) held that a website designer couldn't be compelled to create same-sex wedding websites, ruling that compelled speech violated the First Amendment. Courts are still working out when religious objections allow refusal of services to same-sex couples versus when they constitute illegal discrimination.",
                        modernControversy: "Obergefell remains controversial despite broad public support for same-sex marriage. Justice Thomas suggested in his Dobbs concurrence that the Court should reconsider Obergefell, Lawrence, and Griswold—all based on similar substantive due process reasoning. This alarmed LGBTQ+ advocates. Congress responded with the Respect for Marriage Act (2022), requiring states to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages even if Obergefell is overturned. Religious liberty conflicts continue: can adoption agencies refuse same-sex couples? Can schools be required to recognize same-sex marriage in curricula over parental objections? The law has settled; cultural and religious debates continue."
